# Inversion of Control (IoC)
  What exactly is **Ioc** ?
  > It is simply the design process of externalizing, the construction and management of your objects.
  > *In a nutshell* It basically says, **that your application is gonna outsource the creation and management of objects. And this outsourcing will be handled by a object factory, and that's the big idea of INVERSION OF CONTROL**.

  ###### Coding Scenario

   > App should be configurable means this app should easily work for Coach of another Sport like Hockey, Cricket, Tennis, etc.
